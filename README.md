# Pre-work - *The Game*

**The Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Vincent Tran**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/intriguing-picayune-sunspot?path=script.js%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [X] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [X] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [X] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[Looked up the various functions like setInterval and set timeout on google to make sure I was using them correctly and with the right syntax.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The most challenging part in creating this light & sound memory game was actually just adjusting to the syntax of using html and css because they are fairly new languages to me.
I am pretty used to coding in languages like python and c++, and the syntax in both of these languages are fairly similar in my opinion. Switching and using html and css
was pretty weird for me, and it took some getting used to. It took some getting used to making all of the buttons and different attributes associated with them inside of
html and css, and I had to keep checking the example code to make sure that I was using the correct syntax for all of the code in the program. But once I got used to it,
it wasn't too difficult to implement. When implementing the actual functionality of the code, it was more or less the same as if I was doing it in python or c++. I just had 
to write it in different syntax to make it work given that it is a different language. It took some used to, making all of the functions and variables with different syntax, but
by checking to make sure I was writing it the correct way, I was able to complete the program like I would in a language that I was used to.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[My question about web development is how would a project like this, but on a larger scale be split up so that a whole team of computer programmers would work on it? Would
It be split up so that every team member works on a different feature? Or does every member work on a different file? (in this case the html, the css, and the javascript file)
Or would something like this normally only take one person to work on, and other team members would be working on different projects? I've never worked in the actual industry
before so I am curious as to how the work is set up for a computer programming team.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I spent more time on the project, I would definitely look at what code I already wrote to see if there was any improvement that I could make to it. Considering that this program was
a pretty simple one, I'm not sure how much I would be able to refactor, but it is important to check to see if there is the possibility. Maybe there was a way to improve the loop so that
it could take less lines of code, something like that. After refactoring, then I would look to implemenet more features that I hadn't already put in. Something like an unlimited mode, where
the user would keep guessing until they get it wrong, and their score would be how many rounds they successfully guessed.]
